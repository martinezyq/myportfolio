<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr>
<p>
  <h2>Hi!</h2>  
   <h3>My name is Marcin</h3> 
    <br>I am passionate about visual creation—ranging from photography and filmmaking to graphic design and 3D printing. My work is a blend of creativity, precision, and modern technology, allowing me to bring unique ideas to life while tailoring them to individual needs.</p> <hr>
<p>
  <ul>
  <li>📸 <strong>Photography & Filmmaking</strong> – I capture moments that tell a story. <br> My goal is to create dynamic, cinematic visuals that evoke emotions and leave a lasting impression.  Whether it’s a professional shoot, an event, or a creative project, I strive to bring each frame to life with high-quality editing and a keen eye for detail.</li> <br>
  <li>🎨 <strong>Graphic Design & Editing</strong> – From eye-catching visuals to refined post-production work, I specialize in crafting designs that stand out. Whether it’s branding, digital artwork, or creative retouching, I ensure that every piece is both aesthetically appealing and effective.</li> <br>
  <li>🖨️ <strong>3D Printing & Modeling</strong> – I turn ideas into tangible creations. With a strong background in 3D modeling and printing, I develop precise and functional prototypes, artistic models, and innovative designs for various applications.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<hr>
<p>I believe that great visuals have the power to inspire, engage, and communicate stories in a way that words often cannot. My mission is to not only execute projects but also to push creative boundaries and deliver visually compelling results that make an impact.</p>

<p>If you have a vision you’d like to bring to life, let’s make it happen!</p>
